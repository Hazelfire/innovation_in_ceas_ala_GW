# Using this resource

Moving and documentation over from [other Gitbook](https://app.gitbook.com/s/a3YtWoUiYYfiEQrBNztC/organization-and-overview/how-this-gitbook-works). The present Gitbook should be publicly accessible for viewing (and adding comments?) and we can grant Editor and Creator access by email or by link.  (Creator access is necessary to 'merge' changes, I believe).\
