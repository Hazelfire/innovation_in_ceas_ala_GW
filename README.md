# Cost-Effect-Anal./GiveWell: Explicit uncertainty, transparency, customizability

## This workspace

Started by David Reinstein, Rethink Priorities



## The basic idea&#x20;

GiveWell's analysis is very strong and very important, but it could be even better. \
We think they should do the following, and they can do it without sacrificing accessibility and explainability&#x20;

1. Explicitly embody uncertainty in the model, rather than combining 'best point guesses'
2. Build  the model using code and checkable tools allowing better bug checking, including type-checking (see Pedant)
3. Present the model and results more succinctly, as in Causal's dashboard views
4. Make it easy for users to plug in their own parameters (see 'types of uncertainty') below and assess how the relative cost-effectiveness rankings and outcomes vary with this, helping them determine where to donate and what to support

(Arguably) this will also allow GiveWell to asses and compare a larger set of charities, without sacrificing rigor. \
