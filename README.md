# Cost-Effect-Anal./GiveWell: Explicit uncertainty, transparency, customizability

## This workspace

Started by David Reinstein, Rethink Priorities. See [who-is-involved.md](organization-and-introduction/who-is-involved.md "mention") for other contributors and discussants



## The basic idea&#x20;

GiveWell's analysis is very strong and very important, but it could be even better. We think they should do the following, and they can do it without sacrificing accessibility and explainability&#x20;

1. Explicitly embody uncertainty in the model using 'MonteCarlo', rather than combining 'best point guesses'
2. Build/calculate the model using checkable tools and code, allowing better bug checking, including type-checking (see Pedant)
3. Present the model and results more succinctly, as in Causal's dashboard views
4. Make it easier for users to plug in their own parameters (see 'types of uncertainty' below) and immediately assess how the relative cost-effectiveness rankings and outcomes vary with this, helping them determine where to donate and what to support

(Arguably) this will also allow GiveWell to assess and compare a larger set of charities, without sacrificing rigor.&#x20;



We further discuss this case, and responses, under:

[key-writings.md](organization-and-introduction/key-writings.md "mention")

[limitations-of-givewell](innovations-and-issues/limitations-of-givewell/ "mention")

... and in other sections below.\
