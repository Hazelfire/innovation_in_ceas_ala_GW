# (Limitations of GiveWell)

Givewell presents a model that is transparent and fully explained. However, it is not easy to follow, adjust, check, or run simulations on.&#x20;



They produce and share their model in Google spreadsheets such as the one [HERE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16XOOB1oWse1ICbF0OVXUYtwWwpvG3mxAAQ6LYAAndQU/edit#gid=1377543212), which I've 'forked' [HERE](broken-reference) to be able to comment on and play with. Note that you need to copy ('fork') it to be able to view the underlying formulas. \
\
The calculations are done in the various cells of the spreadsheet. The formulae look like:&#x20;

GW provides a route to specifying your own moral weights and discount rates, involving a blank row and changing an indicator in a dropdown. This then permits you to see the "results" on another sheet. You can go back and forth to see how these change, or how it compares to GW. However, it's not easy to see and compare this 'all in one place'.\
