> Pedant is a minimal math DSL. It's originally designed for use in cost effectiveness analysis. However, it can be used for any important calculations.

> The goal of pedant is to make sure that it's difficult or impossible to make math and stats errors, and also allow for the full enumeration of the assumptions used for a calculation. Currently, its only feature is dimensional analysis, but I'm planning to add stats and constraints on stats in the future.
